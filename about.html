              <h2>Astronomers Assemble!</h2>
              <p>Hi peeps! My name is Shambhavi Jaiswal and I am the content creator of the website Signastronomica. The sole purpose of this website is to provide a platform where people can acess notes based on astronomy and astrophysics.
                  Being an enthusiast myself I have come across hurdles where the content related to even a single topic can be a real pain, as a lot of people are not aware at what level they are and what is the level of the 
                  content provided. Most of the courses covered are covered in third year if you take astronomy as a major but fret not because the information presented will be highly accurate, reliable and easy to understand.
                  Happy learning! Astronomers Assemble! 
              </p>
