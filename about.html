              <h2>Astronomers Assemble!</h2>
              <p> Hello! My name is Shambhavi Jaiswal, an astrophysicist in making. The website, Signastronomica is a platform created for people who are passionate about the universe and the science behind it.
                 Being an enthusiast myself I have come across difficulties in collecting information on various topics. Therefore, I decided to prepare notes that I study from. Most of the courses are covered in third year if you take astronomy as a major but fret not because the information presented will be highly accurate, reliable and easy to understand. I would suggest people to start from stellar astrophysics as presented in the topics.
                  Happy learning!
