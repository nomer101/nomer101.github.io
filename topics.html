           <p>Most students in the science stream have once been great admirers of cosmology,particle physics and astronomy. These three topics are dependant on one another in our understanding of the universe. Usually we do not get the right mentors to guide us on how to ease ourselves into one of the most fascinating sciences. As an enthusiast myself I have seen people favoring popular science books on real informative ones. This website is a platform for real-time study of astronomy though notes and excercises. These are made after a thorough read of the prescribed astrophysics books as per cirriculum followed by universities worldwide.</p>
